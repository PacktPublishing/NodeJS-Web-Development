This book is written for any software engineer who wants the adventure that comes with a new software platform embodying a new programming paradigm.
Server-side engineers may find the concepts behind Node.js refreshing, giving you a different perspective on web application development. JavaScript is a powerful 
language, and Node.js's asynchronous nature plays to its strengths.
Developers experienced with JavaScript in the browser may find it fun to bring that knowledge to new territory.
We assume that you already know how to write software and have an understanding of modern programming languages such as JavaScript.
